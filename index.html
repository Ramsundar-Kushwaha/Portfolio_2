      <p>
        I'm Ramsundar Kumar Kushwaha, a passionate and ambitious software engineering student originally from Nepal, currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Quantum University, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India.
        <br><br>
        My journey in technology has been anything but ordinary shaped by resilience, persistence, and a deep hunger to grow. I come from a hard-working middle-class family, where values like dedication and integrity were instilled in me early on. Though the path has been filled with challenges, each obstacle became an opportunity to rise stronger. With the unwavering support of my parents, I completed my Diploma in Computer Science and Engineering, which laid the foundation for my academic and technical growth.
        <br><br>
        What truly drives me is the belief that success isn't defined by where you start, but by how far you're willing to go. Iâ€™m constantly learning, building, and pushing my boundaries, aiming not just to succeed, but to create meaningful impact through technology.
